# Python Experiments with the Raspberry Pi Sense Hat

This repository contains working code that works with the RPi Sense Hat that has a bunch of sensors and an LED matrix display to name a few.
Each folder contains code that can be run directly on an RPi with the Hat and will even work with the hat emulator if you want to test things out.
